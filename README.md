# CBB - Current work from Feb 2023

This project was a lot of fun for me and I'm excited to update it with more advanced predictive methods this spring 2025. I always loved march madness as a kid and creating a bracket basically feels like christmas.

The current edition of this project is from Feb 2023 where I cranked out some code that scraped season long data from Barttorvik.com. After scraping and scrapping my way through the feature engineering portion I predict the round a team will finish in with linear regression. I also tried creating a model for each seed but I think clustering on seed/other factors will be the way to go for this purpose. 

Very excited to update this later this spring with cleaner code and better analysis, I'll be sure to do a full write-up then.
